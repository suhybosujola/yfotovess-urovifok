Apollo, God of Music, embarks on a journey of reflection and healing as he returns to the place of his greatest tragedy ‚Äì Lacedaemon. Along the way, he is beset by intense memories of his tumultuous childhood, his growth as a God, and his intense first love with the mortal Hyacinthus, Prince of Lacedaemon. It&amp;#039;s a tale of Gods and Men; of lover&amp;#039;s mortal and immortal; of passion and pain; of revenge and remembrance. It&amp;#039;s the Gods as you&amp;#039;ve never seen them before, up close, personal, and practically human.
