Overview
Notes From Your Bookseller Ana Huang and H.D. Carlton fans, we have your new favorite wicked, twisty and oh-so-steamy romance. LIMITED FIRST PRINT RUN—featuring stenciled edges with script design. Only available for a limited time and while supplies last. It all began with just one line. “I’ll wait forever if I have to.” The BookTok sensation PEN PAL is a high-octane, tautly written dark romance with an unforgettable twist that will leave readers gasping. Now with a brand new bonus chapter, this breathtaking romance about undeniable love from superstar J.T. Geissinger is not to be missed! The first letter arrived the day my husband was buried. It was postmarked from the state penitentiary, and contained a single sentence: I’ll wait forever if I have to. It was signed by Dante, a man I didn’t know. Out of simple curiosity, I wrote back to ask him what exactly he was waiting for. His reply? You. I told the mystery man he had the wrong girl. He said he didn’t. I said we’d never met, but he said I was wrong. We went back and forth, exchanging letters every week that grew increasingly more intimate. Then one day, the letters stopped. When I found out why, it was already too late. Dante was at my doorstep. And nothing on earth could have prepared me for what happened next.
